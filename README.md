# TDCED-with-Uncertainties
This is the part of the codes for the T&amp;D coordinated ED problem with uncertainties in distribution demands and generation. 

The simulation is based on a small test case called T6+D7+D9. The testing method is the generalized multi-cut L-shaped method.

It also serves for the support codes of the IEEE PES 2019 General Meeting Paper "Decomposable...in TDCED".

Note that the codes here would not generate the final results as in the paper, since the MIT license here exposes the codes publicly, wich exploits the confidentiality of the author's works. The codes here only provide a general insight and sense for readers to understand.

Contact me if you require further data or materials. No confidential materials or results will be provided.
