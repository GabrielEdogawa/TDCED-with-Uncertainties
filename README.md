# TDCED-with-Uncertainties
This is the part of the codes for the T&amp;D coordinated ED problem with uncertainties in distribution demands and generation. 

The simulation is based on a small test case called T6+D7+D9. The testing method is the generalized multi-cut L-shaped method.

It also serves for the support codes of the IEEE PES 2019 General Meeting Paper "Decomposable...in TDCED".
